# Definitions:
Convolution: dot product of a N1XN1 matrix with N2XN2 filter(matrix) to produce N3XN3 matrix

Filters/Kernels: It's a nxn matrix used to extract a particular feature from the image.

Epochs: Epochs are number of times our model has gone through whole data-set.

1x1 Convolution: convolving on NxN image with a 1X1 filter which is used to promote a feature. 

3x3 Convolution: convolving on NxN image with a 3X3 filter which is used to extract a feature. 

Feature Maps: Feature Maps are channels having same kind of information.

Activation Function: Activation functions are used to boost a particular set of values from the output. 

Receptive Field: Receptive Field of a layer can be defined as how much part of an image is layer looking at.
